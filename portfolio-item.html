                <p>Stock to flow model is a concept that compares the total supply of a commodity to the annual amount mined or generated per year.
                    In the case of bitcoin, the stock to flow ratio compares the total supply of bitcoin which is 21 million to the amount of bitcoin mined per year.
                    It should however be taken into the consideration that in 2009 when bitcoin was produced,1 million BTC was initial mined by Satoshi,
                     who is presumed to be the Creator of Bitcoin.</p>
                <img src="Img/Rectangle 3/Rectangle 3@2x.png" alt="">
                <p> However, an event called Bitcoin Halving which decreases the reward of bitcoin mined from its inception in 2009.
                    This senerio happens whenever 210.000 blocks of bitcoin is mined.Initially the reward for mining a block of BTC was 50BTC in 2009,
                     this value decreased to 25BTC when 420.000 Block of BTC was mined in 2012, the reward for mining decreased to 12.5 in 2016 and 6.25 in 2020.In 2140, 
                     it is expected that all the BTC in existence would have been mined. </p>
                <p> Moving with this event the amount of bitcoin in circulation decreases every four years hence in correlation with the stock to flow model predicting a higher price for bitcoin in the coming years.
                    It should however be taken in to consideration that bitcoin prices is also controlled by the forces of demand and supply.
                    We already know that the supply of Bitcoin reduces constantly and the demand increases,If satoshi decides to release the 1 million BTC initially mined by him into circulation,
                     the supply of BTC will then increase hence lowering the price .</p>
